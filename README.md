Auryn 
=====

Auryn is Simulator for recurrent spiking neural networks with synaptic
plasticity. It comes with the GPLv3 (please see COPYING).

This is a fork of Auryn implementing event-driven random backpropagation for spike-based deep learning.

Quick start
-----------

Note, Auryn needs a C++ compiler, the boost libraries (www.boost.org) with MPI
support installed. To download and compile the examples under Ubuntu Linux try:

```
sudo apt-get install cmake git build-essential libboost-all-dev
git@gitlab.com:eneftci/erbp_auryn.git && cd auryn/build/release
./bootstrap.sh && make
```

Run eRBP
--------

```
cd build/release/experiments/
python2 run_classification_mnist_deep_dual.py
```

This will train a two-layer feed-forward spiking neural network (all to all connections) on MNIST digits as described in <https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05596>.
