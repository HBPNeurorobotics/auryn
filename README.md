This is a fork of Auryn implementing event-driven random backpropagation for spike-based deep learning.

Quick start
-----------

Note, Auryn needs a C++ compiler, the boost libraries (www.boost.org) with MPI
support installed. To download and compile the examples under Ubuntu Linux try:

```
sudo apt-get install cmake git build-essential libboost-all-dev
git clone https://ids-git.fzi.de/friedric/erbp.git
cd erbp/build/release
./bootstrap.sh
make
```
